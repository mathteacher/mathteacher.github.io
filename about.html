title: About
---

I'm currently a stay at home dad in Tacoma, Washington. I previously taught high school math, physics, and computer science from September 2010 - June 2017. My current passions are web development, hiking, seeing live music, playing the piano and guitar, writing, and cooking. I am an eternal friend of the Pelican Man and a humbled veteran of the locust wars.
